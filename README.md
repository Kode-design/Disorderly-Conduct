# Disorderly Conduct

Disorderly Conduct is a neon-drenched, single-page web game inspired by the scrappy chaos of classic crime stories. Create your outlaw persona, then drop into a fully playable 2D side-scrolling tutorial that escalates from sneaking through back alleys to a doomed getaway.

## Features

- **Interactive main menu** with credits and flavour text to set the Atlas City mood.
- **Character customization** covering alias, pronouns, street style, accent colour, and backstory with a live avatar preview.
- **Dynamic accomplice generation** that assigns a randomly named partner and attitude for each run.
- **Side-scrolling tutorial mission** where you move, jump, and interact with the Midnight Express convenience store to pull off the robbery.
- **Heat meter, HUD, and story log** that react to your progress as the police close in.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2. Use the main menu to begin a new session.
3. Customize your character’s details, then lock them in to launch the tutorial level.
4. Use the keyboard controls (A/D or ←/→ to move, W or Space to jump, E to interact, Space to mash through the hold-up) to complete each objective.

No build tools or servers are required—the project runs entirely in the browser.
