# Disorderly Conduct

Disorderly Conduct is a browser-based, side-scrolling crime caper inspired by the high-stakes energy of classic open-world getaways. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game walks you through a fully scripted convenience-store heist that swiftly goes sideways.

## Features

- **Cinematic flow** – Navigate a functional main menu, dig into the control guide, and launch directly into the tutorial.
- **Character customization** – Pick an alias, tweak jacket, pants, and accent colors, and decide between different mask styles before stepping out for the job.
- **2D scrolling tutorial** – Learn to move, jump, and interact while making your way toward the QuickFix Mart with your randomly named accomplice.
- **Step-by-step heist** – Signal your partner, intimidate the clerk, loot the register, and sprint for the alley while objectives and dialogue guide every beat.
- **Scripted finale** – Responding officers corner you, your accomplice bails, and the mission concludes with a narrative summary of your arrest.
