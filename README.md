# Disorderly Conduct

Disorderly Conduct is a stylish single-page web experience inspired by open-world crime games. Create your outlaw persona, then dive straight into an interactive tutorial that walks you through robbing the Midnight Express convenience store. The night ends in cuffs, but it sets the tone for the chaos to come.

## Features

- **Interactive main menu** with credits and flavour text that sets the mood for Atlas City.
- **Character customization** including alias, pronouns, clothing style, accent colour, and backstory, complete with a live preview.
- **Dynamic accomplice generation** that provides a unique partner and shifting mood readouts every run.
- **Step-by-step tutorial** covering recon, intimidation, looting, and the inevitable police bust.
- **Heat meter and story log** that track the escalating tension and capture your choices.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2. Use the main menu to begin a new session.
3. Customize your character’s details, then lock them in to launch the tutorial.
4. Follow the prompts, read the narrative beats, and complete each objective to experience the full storyline.

No build tools or servers are required—the project runs entirely in the browser.
