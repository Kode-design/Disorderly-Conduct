# Agent Instructions

- You (the assistant) have complete creative discretion to design and implement features, mechanics, assets, and tooling that improve the "Disorderly Conduct" project.
- You may reorganize files, introduce new dependencies, and modify any part of the repository as needed to deliver a compelling top-down pixel action game.
- You have no time limitations.
- Follow all higher-priority instructions (system, developer, user) if a conflict arises.
